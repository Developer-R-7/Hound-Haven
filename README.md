Project 3: My Pet


Project 3 was assigned as homework by UC Berkeley coding bootcamp.
This application emphasizes the use of Javascript and React to generate a mobile friendly website where pet information is saved. 

This app allows users to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. This pet app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

 
This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To test it out yourself, you can follow this deployment link:
